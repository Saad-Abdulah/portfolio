I‚Äôve designed and developed desktop applications using WinForms with SQL Server integration, and implemented structured software solutions aligned with SDLC principles, object-oriented design, and design patterns. My academic exposure includes operating systems, database management, software testing, and version control with Git. I also explored AI concepts and integrated automation into web-based systems, enhancing usability and decision-making capabilities. This foundation has equipped me with both low-level and high-level system development skills, preparing me to solve real-world problems with a deep understanding of software systems. Driven by a strong enthusiasm for AI, I continuously explore how intelligent technologies can be leveraged to build smarter, adaptive, and more impactful software solutions.',
